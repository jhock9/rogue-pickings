                    last night. WHOA! The ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was so
                    full in every bite. And that tahini sauce!! It added a tangy twist 
                    that took the whole thing to another level. Also the truck is so adorable
                    and fun - just added to an overall delightful experience!"

                    - spicy, tangy, and savory all at once. The staff was so friendly and I was so amazed
                    at how clean everything was! Very impressed and will definitely be back!"

                    "Yo, the Sizzling Bean Burrito at Rogue Pickings is a revelation. It's a 
                    protein-packed bundle of joy that leaves you feeling satisfied and questioning 
                    who needs meat in a burrito anyway. Just kidding, but no really. The service 
                    was lightnig fast compared to other trucks, and the service was top notch. 100%
                    would recommend."
